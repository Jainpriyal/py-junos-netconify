# Contributions

This directory is for the community to contribute their NOOB Junos configuration files.  Please use the
TEMPLATE.conf and put your files here.  You do *not* need to put the jinja2 template markers, e.g. {{ hostname }},
in the files; static files are OK.  But if you do parameterize the config file that would be greatly appreciated.

Once you've submitted the configuration file, the maintainer(s) of this repo will make a copy of the file, and
add the jinja2 parameters as needed.  Once this process has been completed, the new files will be placed in the
`etc/skel` directory for others to use.

Thank you for your contributions!!
