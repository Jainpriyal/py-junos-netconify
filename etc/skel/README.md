This directory contains the Junos NOOB configuration files, one per each model.  For files that can be used by
multiple devices, you will find these symlinked to the common file.

You can also store any named file here and use the "-M" option to force the file name to be used from this directory.
If you store your config files in other directories, you can use the "-C" option to give the explicit path to the 
file.
